# About DWF

DWF is not approved of, by, or affiliated with MITRE. DWF is community project to assign security identifiers. We would love it if you joined us!

DWF IDs take the form of CAN or CVE, then a 4 digit year YYYY, then an integer identifier XXXXXXX. The integers start at 1000000, anything below one million is a MITRE CVE ID. Anything above one million is a DWF ID. So for example CVE-2021-1000000. Read below to understand the difference between CAN and CVE.

# dwf-form
Repo for the tooling that drives requesting a DWF ID

If you want to request an ID
https://iwantacve.org/

If you are looking for the actual IDs
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwflist

If you want the DWF process and FAQ
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwf-workflow

There are two parts to the request process. The webform accepts user input then
files an issue in GitHub. The form is written in Node.js. It does not support
TLS. You must configure a TLS enabled proxy to use this, secrets are passed
from the client.

There is also a bot that looks at issues in github and commits files to the DWF
ID repo. The bot is written in python because async programming is hard.

# Developing
Please see the [DEVELOP.md](https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwf-request/blob/main/DEVELOP.md) document


# Workflow
The workflow is currently planned to look like this

webform -> issue

We then have a worker look at open issues that need to be assigned DWF IDs
If the issue was filed by a trusted user, assign an ID and close the issue
If the user is untrusted assign a candidate ID then mark the issue as needing review

Issues that received a review can have the ID updated


How to actuall do this

Query github for "new" issues
If ther are new issues
Checkout the repo
Is the user on the trusted list?
yes - Add the DWF ID details
no - Add candidate details
commit the changes
push the branch

Query github for "approved" issues
Is the approver on the trusted list?
yes - continue
no - bail
Checkout the repo
flip the candidate to a DWF ID
commit the changes
push the branch

# Where to file issues

## Tooling discussion
Please file issues about the tooling in the dwf-request repo: https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwf-request/issues

## Contesting/disputing a DWF CVE ID

If you think a DWF CVE ID contains an error or isn't valid please file an issue in the [dwf-workflow](https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwf-workflow) repo.

## General discussion of DWF CVE IDs and the project

If you want to discuss workflow or the DWF CVE ID project in general please use the dwf-workflow repo: https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwf-workflow/issues

# How to request a DWF CVE ID

# What gets a DWF CVE ID?

Any weakness that results in a vulnerability that an attacker can meaningfully exploit.

The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerability in order to cross some sort of trust boundary and have a meaningful effect. It can be a privilege escalation, seeing information they should not have access to, or crashing the system remotely.

Like most things in life there is a spectrum ranging from "obviously this needs a DWF CVE ID" to "this is clearly not a security issue" to "it's somewhere in the middle" some simple examples:

## Definitely needs a DWF CVE ID:

Ping of death v2 (CVE-2020-16898 and CVE-2020-16899) a ping packet sent remotely crashes Windows.

## Probably needs a DWF CVE ID 

Establishing 10,000 connections to a web server that explicitly claims to support 10,000 connections crashes it. Effectively a promise/guarantee was made that is being broken.

An administrative account is embedded in the system with a default password that can be changed, but does not force or encourage the user to change it. This will likely result in an exploitable vulnerability.

## Maybe needs a DWF CVE ID 

Establishing 1,000 connections to a web server that does not make explicit claims about how many connections it supports or under what circumstances makes the web server extremely slow to respond. What about 500 connections? 100? 10? At some point we can agree "10 connection slows the server to a dead crawl is a problem" but what is the upper bound on this? Our suggestion is you file a request so it can be further investigated, researched and discussed.

Official documentation that encourages the use of a known vulnerable configuration, especially when a known secure configuration is available.

Source code and configuration examples that include vulnerabilities, for example SQL code in a textbook that includes an SQL injection vulnerability.

## Definitely does NOT need a DWF CVE ID:

A 100 gigabyte file that when loaded into an image editing program results in a large amount of memory being used. That's just how things work.

# Common problem cases

## Local program crashes

If a file crashes a locally executed program this is generally not DWF CVE ID worthy, unless it completely crashes a program that is commonly handling other data, files or tasks causing a denial of service effect that is noticeable to the user. If the file simply cannot be loaded properly and no other real effect occurs than the simple answer is "it's a broken file, it causes no problem, it just can't be loaded, to bad."

## Fuzzer/Fuzzing results

Fuzzer/Fuzzing results vary tremendously in quality and quantity. As such it is highly unlikely that EACH fuzzing results needs a DWF CVE ID, they need to be properly researched and merged depending on their root cause. Additionally unless a fuzzing result causes an obvious security issue such as remotely crashing a network server it needs to be further researched to determine if there is any meaningful security impact from the fuzzing result. In short with fuzzing results you need to 1) show a security impact and 2) if you have multiple results show that they are unique to some degree (e.g. different file types, crashes with different error messages, etc.)
